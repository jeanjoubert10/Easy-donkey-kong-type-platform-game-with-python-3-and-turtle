# Easy-donkey-kong-type-platform-game-with-python-3-and-turtle
Simple platform type game based on the idea of Donkey Kong using python 3 and Turtle.  
Using platforms lying at an angle makes the collision check a little bit more interesting.  
I am sure it can be done a bit better.  Feel free to look at the code for improvements/questions.

I included 3 codes:
1. Simple with horizontal platforms
2. Short oblique platforms - used to work out the issues
3. Simple attempt at the 'Donkey Kong' type platform game with long oblique platforms and limited jumping ability
